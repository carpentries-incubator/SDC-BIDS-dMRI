This Data Carpentry lesson aims to introduce learners to the analysis of
diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) data using primarily Python. Its
target audience includes researchers willing to discover the dMRI field, as well
as under-graduate or graduate students willing to broaden their skills from
related fields, such as neuroscience, computational neuroscience, or medical
image analysis.

> ## Prerequisites for instructors
>
> This lesson assumes that the instructors have solid knowledge about diffusion
> MRI, scientific programming tools used throughout the lesson ([see the
BIDS-dMRI Setup page](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-dMRI/setup.html)),
and teaching experience.
> If you are teaching this lesson in a workshop, please see the
> [Instructor notes](./guide/index.html).

> ## Prerequisites for learners
>
> This lesson assumes that the learners have a basic understanding of how a
signal or image is represented digitally, an entry-level knowledge about aspects
linked to medical image analysis, and a minimal set of computing and programming
skills to install the required tools and to follow the lesson ([see the
BIDS-dMRI Setup page](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-dMRI/setup.html)).
This lesson requires learners to have completed the [Introduction to MRI and BIDS carpentry](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-IntroMRI/)
corresponding to the Neuroimaging Curriculum.
