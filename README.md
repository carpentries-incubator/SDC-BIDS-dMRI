An introduction to diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) analysis in
Python.

## Why Python?

Python is rapidly becoming the standard language for data analysis, visualization and automated workflow building. It is a free and open-source software that is relatively easy to pick up by new programmers. In addition, with Python packages such as `Jupyter` one can keep an interactive code journal of analysis - this is what we'll be using in the workshop. Using Jupyter notebooks allows you to keep a record of all the steps in your analysis, enabling transparency and ease of code sharing.

Another advantage of Python is that it is maintained by a large user-base. Anyone can easily make their own Python packages for others to use. Therefore, there exists a *very* large codebase for you to take advantage of for your neuroimaging analysis; from basic statistical analysis, to brain visualization tools, to advanced machine learning and multivariate methods!

## About the Lesson

This lesson teaches:
- What diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging is
- How dMRI data is organized within the BIDS framework
- What the standard preprocessing steps in dMRI are
- How local fiber orientation can be reconstructed using dMRI data
- How dMRI can provide insight into structural white matter connectivity
