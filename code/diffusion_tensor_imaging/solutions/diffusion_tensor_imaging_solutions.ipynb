    "## Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion tensor imaging or \"DTI\" refers to images describing diffusion as a tensor model and is derived from preprocessed DWI data. First proposed by Basser and colleagues ([Basser, 1994](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8130344)), the diffusion tensor model describes the diffusion within a voxel. This model has been very influential in demonstrating the utility of diffusion MRI in characterizing the microstructure of white matter and the biophysical properties (inferred from local diffusion properties). DTI is still a commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffusion tensor models the diffusion signal as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{S(\\mathbf{g}, b)}{S_0} = e^{-b\\mathbf{g}^T \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{g}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mathbf{g}$ is a unit vector in 3D space indicating the direction of measurement and b are the parameters of measurement, such as the strength and duration of diffusion-weighting gradient. $S(\\mathbf{g}, b)$ is the diffusion-weighted signal measured and $S_0$ is the signal conducted in a measurement with no diffusion weighting. $\\mathbf{D}$ is a positive-definite quadratic form, which contains six free parameters to be fit. These six parameters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} D_{xx} & D_{xy} & D_{xz} \\\\\n",
    "                              D_{yx} & D_{yy} & D_{yz} \\\\\n",
    "                              D_{zx} & D_{zy} & D_{zz} \\\\ \n",
    "              \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix is a variance/covariance matrix of the diffusivity along the three spatial dimensions. Note that we can assume that diffusivity has antipodal symmetry, so elements across the diagonal are equal. For example: $D_{xy} = D_{yx}$. This is why there are only 6 free parameters to estimate here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors are represented by ellipsoids characterized by calculated eigenvalues ($\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$) and eigenvectors ($\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\epsilon_3$) from the previously described matrix. The computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors are normally sorted in descending magnitude (i.e. $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2$ ). Eigenvalues are always strictly positive in the context of dMRI and are measured in mm^2/s. In the DTI model, the largest eigenvalue gives the principal direction of the diffusion tensor, and the other two eigenvectors span the orthogonal plane to the former direction.\n",

    "- Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (Tournier et al. 2007)\n",
    "- Diffusion Kurtosis (Jensen et al. 2005)\n",
    "- DSI (Wedeen et al. 2008)\n",

    "- OPDT (Tristan-Vega et al. 2010)\n",
    "- Sparse Fascicle Model (Rokem et al. 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "The different algorithms implemented in the `reconst` module all share a similar conceptual structure: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `ReconstModel` objects (e.g, `TensorModel`) carry the parameters that are required in order to fit a model. For example, the directions and intensities of the gradients that were applied in the experiment. The all have a `fit` method, which takes in data, and emits a `ReconstFit` object. This is where a lot of the heavy lifting will take place.\n",
    "- `ReconstFit` objects carry the model that was used to generate them. They also carry around the parameters that were estimated during fitting of the data. They have methods to calculate derived statistics, such as FA and MD (for the tensor), which can differ from module to module. The also all have an `odf` , and most of them (but not all) have `predict` methods, which allow you to predict another data-set based on the a gradient table."

    "Values of FA vary between 0 and 1 (unitless). In the cases of perfect, isotropic diffusion, $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3$, the diffusion tensor is a sphere and FA = 0.  If the first two eigenvalues are equal the tensor will be oblate or planar, whereas if the first eigenvalue is larger than the other two, it will have the mentioned ellipsoid shape: as diffusion progressively becomes more anisotropic, eigenvalues become more unequal, causing the tensor to be elongated, with FA approaching 1. Note that FA should be interpreted carefully. It may be an indication of the density of packing fibers in a voxel and the amount of myelin wrapped around those axons, but it is not always a measure of \"tissue integrity\".\n",
