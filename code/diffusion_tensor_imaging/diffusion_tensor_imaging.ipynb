    "## Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion tensor imaging or \"DTI\" refers to images describing diffusion with a tensor model. DTI is derived from preprocessed diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data. First proposed by Basser and colleagues ([Basser, 1994](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8130344)), the diffusion tensor model describes diffusion characteristics within an imaging voxel. This model has been very influential in demonstrating the utility of the diffusion MRI in characterizing the microstructure of white matter and the biophysical properties (inferred from local diffusion properties). The DTI model is still a commonly used model to investigate white matter.\n",

    "The tensor models the diffusion signal mathematically as:\n",

    "![Diffusion signal equation](../../fig/diffusion_tensor_imaging/diffusion_eqn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where ![Diffusion unit vector](../../fig/diffusion_tensor_imaging/inline_unitvector.png) is a unit vector in 3D space indicating the direction of measurement and b are the parameters of the measurement, such as the strength and duration of diffusion-weighting gradient. ![Diffusion signal](../../fig/diffusion_tensor_imaging/inline_diffusionsignal.png) is the diffusion-weighted signal measured and ![Non-weighted diffusion signal](../../fig/diffusion_tensor_imaging/inline_nondiffsignal.png) is the signal conducted in a measurement with no diffusion weighting. ![Diffusivity](../../fig/diffusion_tensor_imaging/inline_diffusionmatrix.png) is a positive-definite quadratic form, which contains six free parameters to be fit. These six parameters are:\n",

    "![Diffusivity matrix](../../fig/diffusion_tensor_imaging/diffusion_matrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffusion matrix is a variance-covariance matrix of the diffusivity along the three spatial dimensions. Note that we can assume that the diffusivity has antipodal symmetry, so elements across the diagonal of the matrix are equal. For example: ![Symmetry in the diffusivity matrix](../../fig/diffusion_tensor_imaging/inline_diagelements.png). This is why there are only 6 free parameters to estimate here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors are represented by ellipsoids characterized by calculated eigenvalues (![Diffusivity matrix eigenvalues](../../fig/diffusion_tensor_imaging/inline_eigval.png)) and eigenvectors (![Diffusivity matrix eigenvectors](../../fig/diffusion_tensor_imaging/inline_eigvec.png)) from the previously described matrix. The computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors are normally sorted in descending magnitude (i.e. ![Diffusivity matrix eigenvalues magnitudes](../../fig/diffusion_tensor_imaging/inline_sortedeigvec.png)). Eigenvalues are always strictly positive in the context of dMRI and are measured in mm^2/s. In the DTI model, the largest eigenvalue gives the principal direction of the diffusion tensor, and the other two eigenvectors span the orthogonal plane to the former direction.\n",

    "* Tensor (Basser et al., 1994)\n",
    "* Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (Tournier et al. 2007)\n",
    "* Diffusion Kurtosis (Jensen et al. 2005)\n",
    "* DSI (Wedeen et al. 2008)\n",

    "* Sparse Fascicle Model (Rokem et al. 2015)\n",

    "The different algorithms implemented in the module all share a similar conceptual structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ReconstModel` objects (e.g. `TensorModel`) carry the parameters that are required in order to fit a model. For example, the directions and magnitudes of the gradients that were applied in the experiment. The objects all have a `fit` method, which takes in data, and returns a `ReconstFit` object. This is where a lot of the heavy lifting of the processing will take place.\n",
    "* `ReconstFit` objects carry the model that was used to generate the object. They also include the parameters that were estimated during fitting of the data. They have methods to calculate derived statistics, which can differ from model to model. All objects also have an orientation distribution function (`odf`), and most (but not all) contain a `predict` method, which enables the prediction of another dataset based on the current gradient table.\n"

In the cases of perfect, isotropic diffusion, ![Isotropic diffusion eigenvalues](../../fig/diffusion_tensor_imaging/fa_iso.png), the diffusion tensor is a sphere and FA = 0. If the first two eigenvalues are equal the tensor will be oblate or planar, whereas if the first eigenvalue is larger than the other two, it will have the mentioned ellipsoid shape: as diffusion progressively becomes more anisotropic, eigenvalues become more unequal, causing the tensor to be elongated, with FA approaching 1. Note that FA should be interpreted carefully. It may be an indication of the density of packing fibers in a voxel and the amount of myelin wrapped around those axons, but it is not always a measure of \"tissue integrity\".\n",
