    "become a popular choice for recovering the fiber orientation due to their\n",
    "ability to resolve fiber crossings with small inter-fiber angles in datasets\n",
    "acquired within a clinically feasible scan time. SD methods are based on the\n",
    "assumption that the acquired diffusion signal in each voxel can be modeled as a\n",
    "spherical convolution between the fODF and the fiber response function (FRF)\n",
    "that describes the common signal profile from the white matter (WM) bundles\n",
    "contained in the voxel. Thus, if the FRF can be estimated, the fODF can be\n",
    "recovered as a deconvolution problem by solving a system of linear equations.\n",
    "These methods can work on both single-shell and multi-shell data.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to perform the deconvolution over the sphere, the spherical\n",
