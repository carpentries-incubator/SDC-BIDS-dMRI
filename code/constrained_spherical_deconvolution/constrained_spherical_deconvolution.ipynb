    "## Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Spherical Deconvolution (SD) is a set of methods to reconstruct the local fiber Orientation Distribution Functions (fODF) from diffusion MRI data. They have become a popular choice for recovering the fiber orientation due to their ability to resolve fiber crossings with small inter-fiber angles in datasets\n",
    "acquired within a clinically feasible scan time. SD methods are based on the assumption that the acquired diffusion signal in each voxel can be modeled as a spherical convolution between the fODF and the fiber response function (FRF) that describes the common signal profile from the white matter (WM) bundles contained in the voxel. Thus, if the FRF can be estimated, the fODF can be recovered as a deconvolution problem by solving a system of linear equations.\n",
    "These methods can work on both single-shell and multi-shell data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic equations of an SD method can summarized as\n",

    "There are a number of variants to the general SD framework that differ, among\n",
    "others, in the minimization objective and the regularization penalty imposed to\n",
    "obtain some desirable properties in the linear equation framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform the deconvolution over the sphere, the spherical\n",
    "representation of the diffusion data has to be obtained. This is done using the\n",
    "so-called Spherical Harmonics (SH) which are a basis that allow to represent any\n",
