    "performing a non-linear transformation for registration, as each individual\n",
    "diffusion gradient direction would also have to be subsequently warped.\n",
    "Rotation of the diffusion gradient vectors can be done by applying the affine\n",
    "transformation to each row of the file. Luckily, there are existing scripts\n",
    "that can do this. One such Python script was created by Michael Paquette:\n",

    "1. We have only demonstrated the preprocessing steps where there is general\n",
    "consensus on how DWI data should be processed. There are also additional steps\n",
    "with certain caveats, which include denoising, unringing (to remove/minimize\n",
    "effects of Gibbs ringing artifacts), and gradient non-linearity correction (to\n",
    "unwarp distortions caused by gradient-field inhomogeneities using a vendor\n",
    "acquired gradient coefficient file).\n",
    "1. Depending on how the data is acquired, certain steps may not be possible.\n",
    "For example, if the data is not acquired in two directions, `topup` may not be\n",
    "possible (in this situation, distortion correction may be better handled by\n",
    "registering with a T1w anatomical image directly.\n",
    "1. There are also a number of tools available for preprocessing. In this\n",
    "lesson, we demonstrate some of the more commonly used tools alongside `dipy`."
